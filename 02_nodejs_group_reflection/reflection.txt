A.)"Your Role" 
The role that I have in our project is UI/UX Designer. The things that I contributed to our project
are that I help our head UI/UX Designer in designing the format of our project, which will satisfy the project 
requirements and make sure that the system that we will develop is on the right track and can satisfy our clients.
The challenge that I encountered while contributing to this project was the system requirements because this
is the first time that I will need to base on those requirements before completing the project. It caused me 
to have problems because I am not that knowledgeable about things and the terms that are used, but with the help of our 
groupmates, I overcame those problems. After all of that, I learned that I need to be more passionate and cooperative 
in our group project to produce a good quality system.

B.)"Teamwork Experience"
Working with our team is fun for me, I enjoy working with them even though our project is so hard I am happy with our
team because our project team is majority participative and our Project managers are good at coordinating all of our 
tasks. I can say that our team works and communicates well because even though we have some delays in the project schedule, with proper communication we fulfill our project requirements before the deadline.

C.)"Personal Growth and Discipline"
When it comes to my UI/UX Designer role, I want to Improve my time management and give more time to exploring Figma,
to improve my designing skills, and even the figma components usage, I want to develop my skills in this field.
